5. Evaluation Starter Kit (Minimum 20 Test Cases)
Create:

/docs/evaluation_test_cases.md
Include 20 scenarios with:

Pantry snapshot (ingredients + quantities + expiry)
Expected feasibility result (Pass/Fail)
Generated recipe output
Validator output
Notes (what failed and why, if fail)
Required metrics
Feasibility pass rate
“Invented ingredient” rate (should be 0 in default mode)
Expiry utilization rate (if you claim expiry-first)
Average regeneration attempts (if using regenerate-on-fail)
