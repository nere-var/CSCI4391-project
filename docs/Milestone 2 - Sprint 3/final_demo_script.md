# Demo Script

Provide the exact sequence your team will show in class:
- starting state
- login credentials used for demo
- pantry state used in happy path
- prompt used in happy path
- expected validator pass behavior
- pantry state used in failure path
- prompt used in failure path
- expected validator fail/refusal behavior
  
This should read like a checklist for a reliable live demo.

### Global Setup (~ 1 minute)
**Before demo starts:**
- Backend server is running
- database is seeded with demo users
- AI and validator services are active
- inventory system is connected
- .env file has API key present


*Browser is open on the login screen*
