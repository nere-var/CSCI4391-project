# MVP Test Cases 

Provide at least 10 focused MVP test cases that directly exercise the integrated product path.
For each case include:
- test name
- pantry state
- user prompt
- expected result
- actual result
- pass/fail
- notes
  
These should be smaller and more MVP-focused than the Milestone 1 exploratory evaluation set.
